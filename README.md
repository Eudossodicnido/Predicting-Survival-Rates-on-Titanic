This is my analsys on the famous Titanic dataset used for the equally famous [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).
As stated on the official page "The competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck".

My comprehensive analysis and model construction are available [here](https://github.com/Eudossodicnido/Predicting-Survival-Rates-on-Titanic/blob/main/Titanic_Python_Script.ipynb) on Github or [here](https://www.kaggle.com/eudossodicnido/titanic) on Kaggle.
